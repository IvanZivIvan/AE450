# [AE450] Scoring rubric for the Homework Assignment #1

## 0. Disclaimer
>  1. This guideline may contain some typo and errors.
>  2. Although we use MATLAB to do some dirty works, it is highly recommended to see the behind of the curtain(e.g. how to make the controllability matrix, Ackermann's formula, Drawing Bode plot, etc.).  
>  3. There may several other manageable approaches, solutions, and answers to a single problem(e.g. ways of system stability proof, gains or pole locations in feedback controller designs, etc.).
>  Therefore, all reasonable solutions may take full credits.
>  IN OTHER WORDS, HOWEVER, THIS ALSO MEANS GIVING THE SAME ANSWERS ON THE PROBLEMS [2d], [4b], [4c], and [4d] CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A SUSPICIOUS ACT BETWEEN STUDENTS, AND NEED JUSTIFICATION TO TAKE FULL SCORES.
> 4. If you run into any troubles regarding the assignment #1 (error reporting, claims, etc.), ask T.A. in charge for the help. Assistant: Seongheon Lee (skynspace@kaist.ac.kr)
